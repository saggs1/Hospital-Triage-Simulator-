# Hospital-Triage-Simulator
A Python-based console application that simulates a hospital triage system by managing patients in a priority queue based on their medical condition. The system ensures that Critical patients are treated first, followed by Serious, and then Normal cases — mimicking real-world emergency room workflows.

This project is ideal for:
Learning Queues & Priority Handling
Practicing Control Flow & Data Structures in Python

# Features:
1: Add patients with medical priority levels
2: Automatic priority-based queue management
3: Estimated wait time calculation
4: View patient list in treatment order
5: Remove patients after treatment
6: Continuous menu-driven interaction
